# Sequence Diagram Syntax Highlight

Support for the Sequence Diagram in Visual Studio Code.

## Features

Add syntax highlighting for the Sequence Diagram.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
